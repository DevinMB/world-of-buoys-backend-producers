This repo will be for the backend data pipelines.

Data Collected - An Attempt at Simplifying Terminology: 

SRAD Data: 
SRAD1: Solar radiation from direct sunlight (shortwave radiation) at the surface. 
SWRAD: Incoming solar energy (shortwave radiation). 
LWRAD: Longwave radiation, which is the heat radiated back from the Earthâ€™s surface and atmosphere.
